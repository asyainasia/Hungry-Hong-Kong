                    <p>My best food memories are from France when I discovered the facination of food aged ten.<br><br>My parents were determined to broaden our food horizons. We had our first holiday abroad in the west coast of France and I remember the beautiful pale butter, the little parts of redcurrant and yellow plum jams, warm croissants and trying snails.<br><br>My mother was inspired to cook oeufs en cocotte when we came home, buying beautiful little brown glazed cocotte dishes just to try them out. She was then delightened to find them for sale in the Elizabeth David cookery shop some years later. Her careless children had broken the French originals.</p>

                    <p>Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F.<br><br>Generously salt and pepper the chuck roast.<br><br>Heat the olive oil in large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the halved onions to the pot, browning them on both sides. Remove the onions to a plate.<br><br>Throw the carrots into the same very hot pot and toss them around a bit until slightly browned, about a minute or so. Reserve the carrots with the onions.<br><br>If needed, add a bit more olive oil to the very hot pot. Place the meat in the pot and sear it for about a minute on all sides until it is nice and brown all over. Remove the roast to a plate.<br><br>With the burner still on high, use either red wine or beef broth (about 1 cup) to deglaze the pot, scraping the bottom with a whisk. Place the roast back into the pot and add enough beef stock to cover the meat halfway.</p>
